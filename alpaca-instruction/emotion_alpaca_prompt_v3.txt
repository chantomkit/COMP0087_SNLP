4. The rewritten output should prioritize maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the original message while appropriately expressing the desired emotion.
5. The rewritten output must be a standalone piece of text, without any additional labels, tags, formatting, prefixes, explanations, or references to the generation process.
6. If the desired positive emotion does not appropriately fit the context, rewrite the output in an appropriate tone that aligns with the original message.

Please generate the rewritten output and respond with only the modified text, without any extra information. The rewritten output should directly address the [Instruction] and [Input], conveying the [Desired Emotion] concisely and appropriately.
