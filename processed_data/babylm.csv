On 27 June 1872, she embarked on a trip through the mountains with her friend Lucy Renshawe. That day they left Monte Generoso for Venice, one of the three known ways to enter the Dolomites, but not before they had parted from Renshawe's maid and courtier, who disapproved such a journey. Instead the two women hired mountain guides from the region. On 1 July 1872, after a three-day stay in Venice, Edwards and Renshawe left for Longarone, Cortina d'Ampezzo, Pieve di Cadore, Auronzo di Cadore, Val Buona, Caprile, Agordo, Primiero, Predazzo, Fassa Valley, Passo Fedaia, Sasso Bianco, Forno di Zoldo, Zoppè di Cadore and Caprile, and ended their journey in Bolzano. At the time of Edwards's visit, the Dolomites were described as being terra incognita, and even educated persons had never heard of them. This journey was described in her book ""A Midsummer Ramble in the Dolomites (1873),"" later renamed ""Untrodden Peaks and Infrequent Valleys (1873)"". During the expedition, Edwards also searched for the works of Titian, finding a Madonna and Child in Serravalle (Vittorio Veneto) and two other paintings at a village church in Cadore.

data/babylm_data/babylm_100M/wikipedia.train,"In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the yellow-crowned gonolek in his ""Ornithologie"" based on a specimen collected in Senegal. He used the French name ""La pie-griesche rouge du Sénégal"" and the Latin ""Lanius Senegalensis ruber"". Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his ""Systema Naturae"" for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the yellow-crowned gonolek. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name ""Lanius barbarus"" and cited Brisson's work. The species is now placed in the genus ""Laniarius"" that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816.
