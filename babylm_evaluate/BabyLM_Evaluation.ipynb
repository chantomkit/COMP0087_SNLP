        "This notebook allows you to load and evaluate a huggingface model on a subset of BLiMP (a linguistic acceptability judgment dataset) and GLUE (a natural language understanding benchmark collection). It is HIGHLY recommended to clone the GitHub repository and evaluate your model in the command-line; this will give you more freedom in the kinds of models you can evaluate. However, Colab provides a GPU that will allow you to load and evaluate smaller models.\n",
        "\n",
        "To use this notebook:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Start by making a copy of this notebook so that you can make edits and run the code: File > Save a copy in Drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Set Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator to GPU if it isn't already.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Run the setup script to install the required packages for evaluating.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Upload your model to the colab in the `/content/model_folder/` directory. This folder should include the following files, and probably a couple more depending on the type of model and tokenizer you use:\n",
        "* `config.json`\n",
        "* `pytorch_model.bin`\n",
        "* `tokenizer_config.json`\n",
        "* `vocab.json`\n",
        "\n",
        "  a. To obtain these files given your pre-trained model and your tokenizer, load them using huggingface `transformers` and save them using these commands:\n",

        "model.save_pretrained(\"./model_dir\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "  b. Then, upload all the contents of `model_dir` (including any other files not mentioned above) to the `model_folder` folder in this Colab.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Choose the proper model type in the dropdown in the \"load model and evaluate\" cell. Use \"decoder\" for autoregressive (sometimes called \"causal\") language models, like GPT/OPT; \"encoder\" for masked language models, like BERT/RoBERTa; or \"encoder-decoder\" for text-to-text models, like T5/BART.\n",
        "\n",

Its energy can be converted into kinetic energy. This energy can turn a turbine and generate electricity. The water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam.
